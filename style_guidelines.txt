Style Guidelines for IntelliBed 
================================
The overall look and feel for IntelliBed will be minimal and relaxing.
Because our product is designed to promote good sleep, we will keep our design language 
clean without anything flashy and unnecessary. Our goal is to balance the aesthetic of
modern technology and natural, healthy lifestyle.

Colours:
=========
Like most people, we at IntelliBed associate the night time with colours 
that are dark and natural. The dark blue accents we use throughout our website and 
product line reflect the night sky on a cool summer evening. 

These are our colour swatches:
- #3B58BF
- #282387
- #D6BA38
- #3884D6

Iconography:
============
We will focus on using icons that are simple, modern, and relaxing. We will avoid using 
any icons or images that are distracting and take away from our relaxed style.

Typography:
===========
Our main font will be  "BW Quinta Pro Light" by Branding With Type

Links:
======
Links will stand out as a different colour and change when the user hovers over it.
They will not be underlined.

Buttons:
========
Buttons will be flat and simple using the colours outlined above.
